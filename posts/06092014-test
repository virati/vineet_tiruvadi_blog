	Setting up a blog is hard. Yes, there are many tools and frameworks out there built specifically for web content generation, but it's motivation that ultimately bottlenecks the process.

	And yet, here we are. This is a story of how this blog came to be and what I envision for it.

	The main purpose of this blog is to serve as a vehicle for keeping me up to speed on web development. A secondary purpose is to serve as a soapbox on everything from politics to engineering, medicine to (quasi)economics.
