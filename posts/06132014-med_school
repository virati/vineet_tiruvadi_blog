<title>What is an MD/PhD?</title>

	I was a week from graduating college, taking my last final and one last CLEP test to satisfy a graduation requirement. I didn't know what I wanted to do after college but I knew one thing: Medical School was not for me.

	Fast forward to two months ago. April 14th was the first surgery of my PhD career and I was (partly) in charge of our experiments. I worked with the neurosurgeon to decide where the ECoG probes would go, I worked with the psychiatrists to properly set stimulation parameters and I worked with the engineers to record from our ancient amplifiers. This was a special surgery for everyone but it hit me particularly hard. I remember thinking, somewhere in the middle of the surgery, "This is amazing. I want to do this forever."

	"This" will obviously change as I progress through my program, but I knew that I was in my niche, my ecosystem. I'm about to start my second year in the joint MD/PhD program between Emory School of Medicine and Georgia Institute of Technology. I'm about to start my second year of the most absolutely cool thing I can imagine: Deep Brain Stimulation for Treatment Resistant Depression.

	I knew Medical School wasn't for me, but after experiencing a bit of what an MD/PhD was, I quickly suspected I was headed there anyways.

	I'm fascinated by the interface of engineering and medicine. It's a complex ecosystem at this edge. How do the cultures work together? How does problem-solving differ?
